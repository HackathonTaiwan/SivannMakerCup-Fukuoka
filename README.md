The Project made by Sivann and MakerCup at IBM Hackathon in Fukuoka

## Introduction

We want to build an application to help people to take care who they loved, like childrens and parents.

## Background

We have a goal to make a platform to communicate with various devices by using multiple protocols (BLE, Wifi, ZigBee...etc), and also we focus on it for a long time already.
