The Project made by Sivann and MakerCup at IBM Hackathon in Fukuoka

## Introduction

We want to build an application to help people to take care who they loved, like childrens and parents. :-)

## Background

We have a goal to make a platform to communicate with various devices by using multiple protocols (BLE, Wifi, ZigBee...etc), and also we focus on it for a long time already.

## Sadly

Actually, we would like to build a robot army group by using our machine network management platform. Unfortunely, IBM's people tell us it is not easy to control `Paper` robot, so they won't provide any robots if we have no experience on that.

Sadly, we have no chance to hack robot and must change topic.
